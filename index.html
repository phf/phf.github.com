<h1>Peter H. Fröhlich</h1>

<p>I am a Senior Lecturer in the
<a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>
at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, located in beautiful
<a href="https://www.baltimorecity.gov/">Baltimore</a>,
<a href="https://www.maryland.gov/">Maryland</a>.
I hold PhD and MSc degrees in
<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/">Information and Computer Science</a> from the
<a href="https://www.uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine</a> as well as a
Diplom-Informatiker (FH) degree in
<a href="http://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/">Computer Science and Mathematics</a> from the
<a href="https://www.hm.edu/en/">Munich University of Applied Sciences</a>.</p>

<p>My expertise is primarily in systems software, programming languages, and
software engineering.
I work toward efficient, reliable, and secure systems at the intersection of
hardware and software, servers and services.
I am also interested in video game design, computer science education, and the
impact of technology on society.
If you really want to know more, feel free to check out my
<a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phf/">work page</a>, my
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/froehlich">LinkedIn profile</a> or my
<a href="https://nilisnotnull.blogspot.com/">infrequently updated blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re looking at a temporary placeholder for what is supposed to become my
personal website sometime in 2018.
Please bear with me, putting new infrastructure into place is not currently my
highest priority.</p>
